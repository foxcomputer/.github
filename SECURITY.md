We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**, and provide a more detailed response within **a week**, including:

- an initial assessment  
- next steps  
- an approximate timeline for a fix  

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit contributors if desired.

## Scope

Security reports should focus on:

- vulnerabilities in code (logic flaws, data leaks, unsafe behavior, etc.)
- dependency vulnerabilities
- misconfigurations affecting security
- unsafe build or deployment practices

Out of scope:

- feature requests  
- performance issues  
- style or code quality comments

## Responsible Disclosure

Please avoid:

- publicly revealing vulnerabilities before a fix is released  
- exploiting vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to prove their existence  
- accessing private data belonging to others  

We take all reports seriously — thank you for helping keep our projects safe.
